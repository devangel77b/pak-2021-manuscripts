Locomotion- and mechanics-mediated tactile sensing: antenna reconfiguration simplifies control during high-speed navigation in cockroaches
When the tip of the antenna is projected backward, the animals maintain greater body-to-wall distance with fewer body collisions and less leg–wall contact than when the tip is projecting forward
Tested natural and artificial mechanosensory hairs at the tip of the antenna; both  increased an antenna's probability of switching state
